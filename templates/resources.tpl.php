Letter Links Online is designed to be used in conjunction with <i><b>Letter Links:
Alphabet Learning With Children’s Names</b></i> (English and Spanish), or <i>Infant-Toddler
Letter Links: Children’s Names as Meaningful Environmental Print</i> (English). These
HighScope Press books provide detailed information that will help you understand
and use the Letter Links name learning system to strengthen young children’s early
literacy development.
</p>
<p>
Suitable for all early childhood educators, these books take children's natural
interest in learning to write their own names as an entryway to teaching them letter
recognition skills, letter-sound correspondence, and letter/word writing. In the
Letter Links name learning system, each child is assigned a letter link that comes
in two distinct parts: a <b>nametag</b> and a <b>letter-linked image</b> for a word
starting with the same letter and sound as the child's name. Using this system,
teachers can introduce fun-filled activities related to the <b>alphabetic principle,
phonological awareness, sense of word,</b> and <b>vocabulary</b>. The authors
of <i><b>Letter Links</b></i> are reading expert <b>Dr. Andrea DeBruin-Parecki</b>,
early childhood curriculum developer and writer <b>Mary Hohmann</b>, and early childhood
specialist <b>Christine Snyder</b>.
</p>
<p>
These books each provide numerous examples of letter-linked images that may be used
for letter sounds in the language featured. Letter Links Online provides the same
sets of letter-linked images offered in the two books. However, the <i><b>Letter Links</b></i>
books contain a wealth of additional information on the research on early literacy
that underlies the Letter Links system. Both Preschool and Infant-Toddler books
outline <b>eight specific steps</b> to follow when using letter links and provide
<b>more than 20 letter links learning activities</b> for teachers to use in their
classrooms during various parts of the day.
