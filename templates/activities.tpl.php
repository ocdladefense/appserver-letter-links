Once each child in your group has a letter-linked image that starts with the same
letter and sound as the child's name, you can begin to use the nametags and letter-linked
images as teaching and learning tools!
</p>
<p>
You will want to start by using the letter link signs or labels you have created
on this site to identify the spaces for children’s belongings, such as each child’s
cubby and coat hook. In addition, as children make drawings and other projects,
help them add letter links you have duplicated for them to their projects or encourage
them, if they are ready, to write their name or copy their letter-linked image onto
the artwork themselves. In addition to these uses, you can also plan learning activities
around letter links.
</p>
<p>
The following eight starting activities (four for preschoolers and four for infants
and toddlers) will help you support and extend children's emerging understanding
of the alphabetic principle, phonological awareness, sense of word, and vocabulary.

<b>PRESCHOOL ACTIVITIES</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Name Recognition</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Identify names and letter links</b>. Make a set of letter links (nametags
with pictures) in two or three sizes for each child and adult in your class. At
a <b>transition time</b>, spread all the letter links face up on a table
or the floor where the children can easily see and reach them. Ask the children
to choose their own letter link and take it to their small-group meeting place (or
whatever event comes next in the daily routine).
<br />
<br />
At a <b>transition time</b>, provide a set of letter links (nametags with
pictures) in a box, bag, or spread out on a tray. Hold up a child's letter link,
and say "It's [name] turn to hop to the table for snack [or whatever is next]."
Wait for one of the children to recognize and say the name of the child whose letter
link you are holding.
<br />
<br />
At <b>large-group times</b>, use letter links from time to time to designate
turns — to choose the next song to sing, to decide which game to play next, to add
on to the story you are telling, and so forth. For example, hold up a child's nametag
and picture and say "It's [name] turn to decide the place in the room we
should march to next."
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
<b>Match letter links</b>. Make a set of letter link cards (nametags with
letter-linked pictures) that will allow children to play a letter link memory game
at transition times. Duplicate all of the cards in the same size, with two for each
child. Cover the cards with clear contact paper for durability. At the end of a
segment of your routine such as small group, planning, or greeting time, spread
all the nametag cards face down on the floor. Have each child take turns turning
over a card, identifying the name, and leaving the card face up. When two cards
turn up with the same name, have the named child hop (jump, skip, or crawl) to the
next activity. Let the children know where the nametag cards will be stored (for
example, in the toy area) in case they want to play with them during work or choice
time.
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
<b>Identify names</b>. At a <b>transition time</b>, place a
set of nametags only (without the letter-linked pictures) in a basket or bag. Draw
and hold up a child's nametag, and say "It's [name] turn to jump to the planning
table [or whatever event is next in your daily routine]." Wait for one of the children
to recognize and say the name of the child whose nametag you are displaying. If
no one can identify the name, hold up the letter-linked image that goes with it.
<br />
<br />
At large-group times, use nametags (without letter-linked pictures) from time to
time to designate which child will choose the next song to sing, decide which game
to play next, add on to the story you are telling, and so forth. For example, hold
up a child's nametag and say "It's [name] turn to decide which music we should
put on for dancing." If no one can identify the name, hold up the letter-linked
image that goes with the name.
<br />
<br />
At a <b>transition time</b>, once most children can identify their names
without referring to their letter-linked pictures, put two sets of nametags in a
basket or bag. To begin the activity, say something like this: "I have two nametags
for each person in my basket. When I hold up your name, come and get it. When you
have your two nametags, one for each hand, you can go wash your hands."
<br />
</li>
</ol>
<b>Name Writing</b>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<b>Sign in</b>. In some preschool centers, children’s parents or guardians
are required to sign their child in when they arrive and sign them out when they
leave together at the end of the session. For these children, signing in themselves
is particularly meaningful, in part because children love to imitate what they see
adults doing. Whether or not parents are required to sign in, you can make signing
in a daily part of the children’s class routine that allows them to write their
names and examine the way others write.
<br />
<br />
Use the sign-up sheet print option to create a sheet for your class and have one
available daily. Even though the list provides each child with a sample of his or
her name to look at, remember that children learn to see and write their name in
stages. You will see these stages in all their varieties as children sign in each
day. Some children will just make a scribble next to their names, others may write
one or more letters, and others may write their entire name. Date and save each
piece for a daily record of how each child is seeing and writing his or her name.
If all children do not have a chance to sign in as they arrive or during morning
gathering, assure them that they can sign in during work or choice time, before
lunch, or at some other time that day.
<br />
<br />
Comment from time to time on what you see children writing as they sign in: "You
made a <em>J</em> just like the <em>J</em> in <em>James</em>." "Mira and Madison,
both your names start with the letter <em>M</em>!"

<b>INFANT-TODDLER ACTIVITIES</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Learning Environment and Materials</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Make a name and letter link book.</b> Create a book or a ring of cards
with a page or card for each child and adult in the class. Include the person’s
photo, name, and letter link on each page or card. One book or ring can be made
for each primary care group or for the whole classroom. Store the book or ring of
cards in the classroom at the children’s level so they are able to hold it and look
through it frequently.
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
<b>Label children’s art or other work using their letter links.</b> Use
small tags or mailing labels with children’s names and letter-linked images or draw
the child’s letter-linked image to label two- and three-dimensional artwork and
writing samples. This will increase children’s familiarity with their letter link
and also help them to identify and distinguish their own work. Point out to children
why you are labeling their work: to indicate that the work belongs to them! Point
to their name and remind them of their letter link.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Schedules and Routines</b>
</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<b>Identify alliterations.</b> Send older toddlers to the next activity
at a <b>transition time</b> by identifying the alliterative sounds in
their names and letter links. For example, you might say something like this: “Today,
I’m going to say a word that starts with the same sound as your name and then say
your name. When you hear two words that start with the same sound as your name,
you can go to snack. Here we go!” Say the letter link and the name slowly, with
an emphasis on the initial sounds: “Flower, Flora.” [Pause for Flora to respond.]
“Apple, Anna.” [Pause.] “Kite, Kayla,” and so forth.
<br />
<br />
At <b>another transition</b>, add a third alliterative word to each child’s
name and letter-linked phrase. For example, you might say, “Today, listen for three
words — your name and two other words that start with the same sound and letter.
Ready? Volcano, vise, Vinnie.” [Pause for child to respond.] “Yes, Vinnie — volcano,
vise, and Vinnie all start with the same /v/ sound! Vinnie, you can get your book
for nap.” [Pause.] “Listen to these words: Star, steps, Steve...,” and so forth.
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
<b>Explore letter-shaped cookie cutters and play dough during group time with materials.</b>
For group time, offer each child a basket with paper, their letter link, play dough,
and the cookie cutter letters required to spell the child’s name or the first letter
of their name. Include the first letter of other familiar names, such as <i>M</i>
for <i>Mom</i>, or <i>D</i> for <i>Dad</i>, or the first letter of a sibling’s name.
Children may be more focused on exploring the dough but as they explore, name the
letters and point out that those letters make up the child’s name (or a familiar
name).
