The Letter Links name learning system pairs a child’s printed nametag with a letter-linked picture for a word that starts with the same letter and sound. For example, Debbie’s letter link includes her nametag plus a picture of a duck or a deer, and Teodoro’s might include his nametag plus a picture of a tepee or a turtle.
